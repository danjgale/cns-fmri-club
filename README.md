# cns-fmri-club
Website for the CNS fMRI club

The goal of the fMRI club is to bring together graduate trainees, researchers, and technicians who use functional MRI in their research to discuss new & exciting fMRI papers, methodologies, data pipelines and software. The format of this club will be a mix of reviewing papers, demonstrations of data analysis pipelines and visualization software, and presentations of fMRI pilot data or new protocols to get feedback from the group. Ultimately the goal is for fMRI trainees, researchers and technicians to learn from each other's fMRI expertise (including protocols, data collection, analysis and reporting) and to cover current topics in the field.

Each meeting someone will take the lead on presenting a paper, software, or pilot data to the group. When a paper is selected, all group members will be expected to read it and the presenter will be responsible for creating slides of the relevant data figures/methods to facilitate group discussion.

**When**: Biweekly on Thursdays, 12-1pm (starting on Jan 9th, 2020)  
**Where**: Bracken Library
